# Simple OpenCV Face Recognition using Face Recognition using Haar-Cascade Classifier, Python2 and Python3


Face Recognition tutorial refference for http://coders.uphero.com/ 


### Requarements:
* Python 2.x
* OpenCV 2.x
(OR)
* Python 3.x
* OpenCV 3.x

Python Lybrary:
* cv2
* os
* Numpy
* Pillow/PIL

### Detais
This project consist of 3 parts, which are:
1. Creating datasets (face_datasets_creator.py)
2. Train the model (image_trainner.py)
3. Face Recognition (face_recognition.py)

### Installing

* Create an empty Folder named **"dataSet"** in the same directory where the python scripts are.
* Create an empty folder called **"trainner"** in the same directory.

## Running the tests

* 1. Run in the command line the "face_datasets_creator.py" and enter a unique id to create face samples with your face. Don't forget to set each person's face to unique ID (You need to edit the code everytime, or maybe just change the id variable to raw_input[OPTIONAL])
* 2. If you have more face to be include, change the ID and run the program again.
* 3. Loade your datasets by running "image_trainner.py"
* 4. Lastly, run "face_recognition.py"
